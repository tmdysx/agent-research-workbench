## What is this

Many people use AI to polish their papers and end up with something that reads like a self-audit: before the reviewer says a word, the text is already full of "unfortunately", "limited improvement", and "still lags behind". Work-report structure, self-censoring language — **it hands the reviewer a knife, with a user manual attached.**

This is **defensive writing**.

The antidote is one principle:

> **A paper is a press conference, not a project summary.**
> A press conference says exactly one thing: your strongest advantage.

Never set a contest you cannot win. Never say you lost. Experiments are tools of argument, not a warehouse of results. Persuasion comes from tight claim-evidence alignment, not from the number of comparisons.

## Before / After

| | Defensive writing | Press-release principle |
|---|---|---|
| Weakness framing | Although our method improves accuracy on two in-domain datasets, we must acknowledge that cross-domain generalization has not been tested, so these results should be interpreted cautiously. | Our method improves accuracy on two in-domain datasets; cross-domain generalization has not been evaluated. |
| Structure | We first tried A, then B, and finally chose C | Problem X matters, existing methods lack Y, we propose Z, evidence follows |
| Experiments | An appendix-style pile of results | Every experiment carries one argumentative duty |
| Conclusion | Sudden self-negation in the final paragraph | Reinforces the takeaway only |

## Quick start

### Option 1: Copy the prompt (works with any AI)

Copy [`prompts/quick-prompt-en.txt`](prompts/quick-prompt-en.txt) ([中文](prompts/精简版提示词.txt)) and paste it at the start of your AI conversation, then send your paper draft. ~400 words, zero setup.

### Option 2: Install the Skill (Claude Code / Cursor / other agent tools)

Copy the skill folder of your preferred language into your skills directory:

```bash
# English
cp -r skills/anti-defensive-writing-en ~/.claude/skills/

# 中文版
cp -r skills/anti-defensive-writing ~/.claude/skills/
```

Then just ask "polish this paragraph" or "revise my abstract" — the agent applies the press-release principle automatically.

## The 12 rules at a glance

- **Narrative**: organize around strengths only · no work-report chronology · never set a contest you can't win · state advantages explicitly · limit comparison scope · allow full story restructuring
- **Language**: ban self-weakening phrases · never say you lost · never turn a local observation into a verdict on the whole method
- **Experiments**: every experiment needs an argumentative duty
- **Structure**: abstract & intro = press-conference opening · conclusion only reinforces the takeaway
